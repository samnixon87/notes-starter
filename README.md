## Chapter 2B - Getting Started

If you want to carry on with your code after Chapter 2A please do! All you need to do is simply add a new folder on the same of the folder structure as the `frontend` folder and call it `backend`.

In the command line that would look like this:

```bash
mkdir backend
```

Alternative, you can use the branch for files for Chapter 2B. To do that, checkout the 2B branch and then make the directory for the backend.

```bash
git checkout 2B-starter-files
mkdir backend
```
Installation and startup instructions are included in the videos for this section of the course.
