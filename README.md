# notes-starter

Welcome to Notes - Chapter 2 of the Fullstack Javascript course for SuperHi! This repository is designed to help you understand how to build full stack applications using TypeScript. It covers both the frontend and backend, using React (with Vite) and Node.js (with Express).

The repository is divided into three branches:

- **Master**: The finished code.
- **2A starter**: Starter code for the frontend (React + Vite).
- **2B starter**: Starter code for the backend (Node.js + Express).

## Chapter 2A - Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:samnixon87/notes-starter.git
git checkout 2A-starter-files
```

Then navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd notes
npm install
```

And finally run the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Chapter 2B - Getting Started

If you want to carry on with your code after Chapter 2A, then simply add a new folder on the same of the folder structure as the `frontend` folder and call it `backend`.

In the command line that would look like this:

```bash
mkdir backend
```

Alternative, you can use the branch for files for Chapter 2B. To do that, checkout the 2B branch and then make the directory for the backend.

```bash
git checkout 2B-starter-files
mkdir backend
```
Installation and startup instructions are included in the videos for this section of the course.
